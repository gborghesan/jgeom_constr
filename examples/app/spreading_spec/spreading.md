# PR2 Spreading Specification

The following folder contains the task specifications used in the _PR2 (tomato) Spreading Specification _
The whole application has been realized by enconding these specs into a Finite State Machine (FSM) as follow:

  1. move_spoon_above_the_center
  2. move_spoon_to_the_center
  3. spread_action

The sequence is then repeated. By changing the angle direction during multiple interactions,
 a circular area (as a pizza) can be covered
The video of the demo can be found [http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~u0072295/videos/ts_paper.mp4](here).
